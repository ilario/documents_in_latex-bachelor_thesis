	abstract = "Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The preparation of CdSe nanospheres (ns-CdSe) and their application as electron acceptor in conjugated polymer photovoltaic devices are reported. ns-CdSe with diameters of 5 nm were prepared through an organometallic method. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicate that the CdSe nanocrystals (NCs) are monodispersed nanospheres with the first exciton absorption peak at around 625 nm and the emission peak at around 652 nm. The PL spectra of the ns-CdSe/polymer composite films show that the PL of the conjugated polymers is effectively quenched upon the addition of ns-CdSe. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated from the composites of ns-CdSe and poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) or poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Under AM1.5 illumination (100 mW/cm2), the short circuit current (I SC), open circuit voltage (V OC), fill factor (FF) and energy conversion efficiency (η) reached 1.56 mA/cm2, 0.75 V, 34.5\% and 0.40\%, respectively for device from the ns-CdSe/MEH-PPV (15: 1 by weight) and 1.93 mA/cm2, 0.65 V, 38.4\% and 0.48\%, respectively for device from the ns-CdSe/P3HT (10: 1 by weight).",

	abstract = "Oleic acid (OA) modified zinc-blende cadmium selenium nanocrystals (NCs) with different diameters, 3--5 nm, have been prepared. We find that the morphology and fluorescent properties of the samples are related to the preparation conditions such as the chain-length and concentration of the cadmium precursor as well as the concentration of OA. The hybrid solar cells based on the obtained spherical CdSe NCs as an acceptor and Poly(2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexoxy)- p -phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV) as a donor show an energy conversion efficiency (ECE) as high as 0.85\%, three times higher than that reported before for spherical CdSe NCs/conjugated polymer hybrid solar cells. When poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is used as the donor phase instead of MEH-PPV, the energy conversion efficiency increases up to 1.08\%. The solar cell based on CdSe NCs/conjugated polymer has the potential to open up new production technologies for hybrid solar cells based on semiconductor NCs."
